# Algorithims
Assignment solutions for Princeton-Coursera class taught by Robert Sedgewick, author of Algorithms (4th Edition), the leading textbook on algorithms today and is widely used in colleges and universities worldwide. This book surveys the most important computer algorithms currently in use and provides a full treatment of data structures and algorithms for sorting, searching, graph processing, and string processing--including fifty algorithms every programmer should know. In this edition, new Java implementations are written in an accessible modular programming style, where all of the code is exposed to the reader and ready to use.


percolation - 2 dimensional percolation model

collinear - efficient algorithim for finding points in a line on a 2D plane

Deque - efficient algorithim for a Deque and RandomList

8puzzle - implemented A* , an AI algorithim, for searching for find the shortest solution to a slider puzzle

kdTree - implemented a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space
